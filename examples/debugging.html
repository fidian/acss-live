        <p>
            Acss-Live is able to show some extra debugging information about how
            long it takes to process elements, the found classes, and when the
            mutation observer is fired. This all goes to the console and is
            enabled by adding <tt>debug: true</tt> to <tt>acssLiveConfig</tt>.
