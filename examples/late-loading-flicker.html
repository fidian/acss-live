        <p>
            This shows a problem when loading a script late (after elements are
            in the DOM). You may see a flicker as styles are generated. If not,
            try reloading several times and watch the header carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
            One method for addressing this is to simply
            <a href="late-loading-hide.html">hide the content</a> until
            acss-live is loaded. Another solution is to move the
            <tt>script</tt> tag into the head of your page.
        </p>
    </body>

    <!-- Intentionally load late in order to prove that styling exising
        elements works and to test if there is an unstyled flicker -->
    <script src="../acss-live.js"></script>
</html>
