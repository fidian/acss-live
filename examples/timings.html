        <p>
            This version of Acss-Live has timings and performance measurement
            <span class="Fw(b) Tt(u)">enabled</span> and the page will reload
            automatically many times while measuring how long key portions of
            code take. The results will be displayed in the console, so make
            sure that is open in the end.
